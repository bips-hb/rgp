Description: A package for analyzing healthcare claims data and
  simulated data using penalized regression and machine learning methods.
  This package contains function wrappers to create a simulated cohort,
  group predictors based on functional targets (from KEGG and TTD) and
  conventional groups (ATC/ICD systems) and analyze the data using various types
  of penalized regression (LASSO) and machine learning methods (random forests and
  block forests).
